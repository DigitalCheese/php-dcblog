echo '<h1>What Is This Page?</h1>
This page is what you get when you have a non-existent comment link or intentionally removed extra queries so you got a pure /c/ link. It is also a tutorial for linking comments you see on my articles, status posts, media gallery, and archive. If you see this and you are sure you typed your comment right, try going to the link. If it fails, re-type it and see if it works. If it still does not work, your link is probably invalid.
<br><br>
If you believe your link is not invalid, please contact me (see footer or homepage) and I will attempt to resolve the issue. Include the comment ID, otherwise I can not help you. I usually do not remove comments, so if the comment was not deleted by the owner, it will still be up with very few exceptions.
<h1>How To Link Comments?</h1>
1. Go To Comment You Want To Link<br>
2. Click "Permalink"<br>
3. Copy The Link Given<br>
4. Share It Elsewhere
<br><br>
A valid link will look like the below:<br>
digitalcheese.xyz/c/?id=123
<br><br>
It is only 3 characters long because it is to the 36th power (A-Z and/or 0-9 at 3 characters long). 3^36 is 150,094,635,296,999,140 comments possible, or a few quadrillion. I will likely never reach this limit and even if I do, I could just make it 3^62 (upper/lowercase A-Z + 0-9) or X, which would be enough until the end of time basically. If I still ran out somehow, I would make things 5^62 which would be Z possible number of comments.
<br><br>
TLDR; Links are short please use /c/?id=123 links uwu.'
